# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System combining a Rust-based packet sniffer with a Python machine-learning pipeline for anomaly detection.

This project is developed as a Final Year Project with a focus on network traffic analysis, unsupervised detection, and robust system design, rather than signature-based rules.

📌 Overview

• Traditional intrusion detection systems often struggle with:

• Zero-day attacks

• Encrypted traffic

• Evolving network behaviour

This system instead focuses on:

• Statistical traffic features

• Unsupervised anomaly detection

• Sensitivity calibration to balance false positives and detection accuracy

The aim is not only to detect anomalies, but to understand and analyse network behaviour.

🧠 Project Focus

• Packet-level network analysis

• Feature extraction and aggregation

• Machine learning–based anomaly detection

• Robustness and repeatability of results

The project is intentionally modular to allow experimentation and evaluation.

🦀 Rust Component (Packet Sniffer)

Location: RustSniffer/

Responsibilities:

• Live packet capture

• TCP and UDP protocol parsing

• Timestamping and metadata extraction

• High-performance, low-level traffic handling

Rust is used for its memory safety, performance, and suitability for long-running network tools.

🐍 Python Component (Detection & ML)

Location: Python/

Responsibilities:

• Feature engineering from captured traffic

• Aggregation of packets into flows

• Sensitivity calibration

• Unsupervised anomaly detection

The Python layer enables flexibility in data processing and model experimentation.

⚙️ Key Concepts Implemented
Feature Aggregation

Raw packets are grouped into higher-level traffic features such as volume, timing, and protocol behaviour to reduce noise and improve detection stability.

• Sensitivity Calibration

• Detection thresholds are tuned to minimise false positives while maintaining detection capability.

• Robustness & Repeatability

The pipeline is designed to produce consistent results across similar traffic conditions.

📊 Current Status

• Packet capture implemented

• Python ingestion pipeline operational

• Machine-learning inference working

• Data storage and logging verified

• Ongoing work includes evaluation, calibration, and analysis.
